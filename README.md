# ‚ö° Electricity Bill Prediction Platform

Welcome to the **Electricity Bill Prediction Platform**! This project aims to predict electricity bills based on various factors such as consumption, demographic information, and environmental variables using machine learning models.

## üöÄ Features

- **Upload Dataset**: Upload your dataset in CSV format and choose the target variable for prediction.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor) to train the model.
- **Performance Metrics**: View performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R¬≤ Score, and Adjusted R¬≤ Score to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations to compare actual vs predicted values and perform residual analysis.
- **Prediction Interface**: Input feature values to predict the electricity bill and see the result instantly.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web app.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building machine learning models and data preprocessing.
- **Plotly**: For visualizing the performance metrics and prediction results.
